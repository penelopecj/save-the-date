                Do we have a gift registry?
              </strong>
              <p>
                We have decided not to make a wedding gift registry, as we only live in a small flat and don&apos;t have much space. However, as you have been generously requesting to send gifts, we have come up with a few ways below to accept contributions in US Dollars or GB Pounds towards our future home.

                How will we get from the hotel to the wedding venue?
              </strong>
              <p>
                We have booked a 56-passenger coach to drive some of you from the hotel to the venue at 5:30pm on Sunday 10th July and back again at the end of the night. Space on the bus is limited, so we encourage you to drive if you will have a car at the hotel.

                Will we have breakfast all together at the hotel before we leave?
              </strong>
              <p>A private farewell breakfast will be served on on Monday 11th July from 10:00am to 12:00pm. Please let us know if you book a room so we can provide enough breakfast for you.</p>

                Where are we staying before the wedding?
              </strong>
              <p>
                Zac and Penny will be staying at the <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.hyatt.com/en-US/hotel/new-york/hyatt-place-long-island-city-new-york-city/lgazl">Hyatt Long Island City</a> in the New York City borough of Queens for two days before the wedding.

                Where are we going after the wedding?
              </strong>
              <p>
                Zac and Penny will be leaving after breakfast on Monday 10th July to stay for a few days at the base of Mt Washington in New Hampshire. Phone signal will be poor, so best not to contact us about anything after the wedding...

              </strong>
              <p>
                You will be greeted with food and champagne on arrival. After the ceremony, there will be a cocktail hour with passed hors doeuvres, hot food stations, cold food stations, and lots of vegetarian options. Finally, you will have your order taken for a three-course, sit-down meal. The expected menu can be viewed at the bottom of the <Link to="/venue">venue</Link> page. The entire event is top-shelf open bar.
